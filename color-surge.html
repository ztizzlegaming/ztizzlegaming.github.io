    <h1>Privacy Policy for Color Surge</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 1 2026</p>

    <p>
        Color Surge is a free mobile game developed by Jordan Turley.
        Your privacy is important, and this Privacy Policy explains how information
        is handled when you use the app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        Color Surge does <strong>not collect, store, or share any personal information</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The app does not require users to create an account, and no personally identifiable
        information (such as name, email address, location, or device identifiers) is collected
        by the developer.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h2>
    <p>
        Color Surge uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
        AdMob may collect certain information automatically, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information</li>
        <li>Advertising identifiers</li>
        <li>Approximate location</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This data is collected <strong>by Google</strong>, not by the developer of Color Surge,
        and is governed by Google’s own Privacy Policy.
    </p>

        All game progress, settings, and in-game data are stored
        <strong>locally on your device only</strong>.

    </p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Color Surge does not knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13.
        Since no personal data is collected at all, the app is safe for general audiences.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

        services that collect user data.
